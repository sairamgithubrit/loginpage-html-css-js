# loginpage-html-css-js
The beginning of the journey in (front-end) web development can be daunting. The markup is really weird at first. CSS some times makes your page beautiful, other times you have no idea why a single property turned your page into a mess. And in case this is your first time working with a programming language, JavaScript might be the most daunting of the three.

But, when you finally have a grasp of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, what do you do with them? Practice. Think of something you want to do with your newfound knowledge, it doesn’t matter if it’s “useful”, it doesn’t matter how complex it is. Just do something that helps you get better at HTML, CSS and JavaScript. And please, never forget the value of building dumb sh*t :)

Today, as you have already found out from the title, I will be walking you through the creation of a login page using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. But don’t worry. Again, as the title says, this is your first login page, which means the code is as simple as possible and there will be an explanation to accompany each piece of code.
